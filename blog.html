        <p>I have been playing Dark Souls lately, and it has gotten me thinking about video game design, mostly because its design is just so gosh-darned good.Everything about the game pulls me in, and I think part of it is that it knows how to keep a light touch when building the experience. Now "light" may not be the first word that springs to mind when thinking about Dark Souls, but I'm not referring to tone or gameplay. I'm referring to how it paces and presents its world and its story.</p>
        <p>If you have played a lot of video games, you probably understand the basic layout that a typical RPG, MMO, or "action-adventure" game takes: you design a character, said character might get some backstory, you walk through a tutorial (perhaps several tutorials over time), a conflict is presented and explained, and then people start giving you quests or missions or objectives, depending on the exact flavor. The quests unfold into an overarching narrative in which your character plays a vital role and which is described to you at every step. MMOs in particular fall into this groove. Meanwhile, in Dark Souls, you are given a vague and aggressively morally ambiguous story of gods fighting dragons and fussing over fire, given some basic controls and a vague goal (the meaning of and path to which is completely unclear), and plopped in front of a giant demon that will probably kill you a few times before you can chip it to death. There is a lot of story, to be sure, but it is not fed to the player; it must be found and pieced together. A linear string of quests and directions is nowhere to be found, only an unforgiving world waiting to kill you.</p>
        <p>I think there are a lot of elements from Dark Souls that can be applied to a game designed for the visually impaired. I'm not saying Dark Souls itself is; it obviously depends on visuals for the player to fight and explore. However, there are some non-visual elements that I think could form the basis of a game in and of themselves. Specifically, I want to discuss the exploration and the music in Dark Souls.</p>

        <h2>Exploring the world</h2>

        <p>Perhaps you don't find the Dark Souls approach appealing to you subjectively, but speaking objectively, there is one thing that is true about Dark Souls: the density of information presented at any one time is lower than the standard game experience described above. This comes from its focus on exploration: while the sheer openness of the game can be daunting, it isn't information that you have to deal with all at once. The information given is essentially the place you are in, the different paths into and out of that place, and the (relatively sparse) items in the room. There aren't twelve different quest givers vying for your attention, there aren't 50 shops lined up that you have to peruse for items slightly better than the one you have. The amount of information in an exploration-based game may be large, but it doesn't always occupy the forefront of your mind. You can connect the new information you discover piece by piece with previous areas to build a larger understanding of the environment in your mind. That's the key: a lot of understanding is done mentally, not directly in front of you through an exposition dump in dialogue. Note that this is true of a game presented visually or through audio: its much more interesting to see the world unfold before you than it is to be given it all at once, and its easier to consume a smaller amount of intersting tidbits of audio than it is to trek through massive lists of information and items that may or may not be relevant to you.</p>
        <p>So a hands-off exploration-based game is probably more suited to visually impaired players than a linear one, due to a less dense presentation of information. There is another element of Dark Souls which is closely tied to its exploration: the sound design, specifically the music.</p>

        <h2>Orienting yourself with music</h2>

        <p>Keeping with the theme of sparseness, Dark Souls doesn't spray you with music and sound effects. As a result, those auditory elements that are there are quite distinctive and memorable, and they serve as an element of familiarity to the locations they are tied to. Two specific places come to mind. Firelink Shrine is one of the few places in the game that has music in the background (aside from boss fights), and whenever I go back there, the music gives me a real sense of calm as I come back to a familiar place. In another area, the pounding of a hammer indicates the blacksmith is nearby, a friend who can help and encourage me.</p>

        <p>Applying this to audio-based games, once a player has associated a song or sound with something, you have just taken part of the burden of orienting the player within the world off of your textual description. Instead of saying, "You are in Firelink Shrine," or, "The blacksmith is to the left," you can just play the background track or play the sound effect in the left side of the audio, respectively. Plus, these audio landmarks can always be playing in the background, smoothly moving to another layer of consciousness while the player consumes other textual information directly. In this way, we can construct an exploration-based game with the player moving through different soundscapes, instead of listening to list after list of text.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>

        <p>There are a lot of things about current video games that are inherently visual, but that doesn't mean there is no overlap between current game design and accessible games. Leveraging these existing aspects of games in ways that build a world non-visually will not only lead to more accessible games, but perhaps even better game design in general. If you can create an interesting, navigable world with sound, you are in a much better mindset to design content to be consumed visually as well.</p>
