			<h2>Single-switch auto-scanning calculator</h2>
			<p>Press Enter to simulate the switch being pressed. Scan speed is 500 ms (1/2 second). <a href="../assignment8_alt/index.html">View alternate layout.</a></p>
			<h2>Trial: Alternate calculator layout</h2>
			<p>Hypothesis: An alternate calculator layout (see link above) that separates the numbers from the operations will improve single-switch performance.</p>
			<p>Rationale: The traditional calculator layout is not designed for row/col scanning, and it mixes numbers and operations in the same rows. A layout that separates out the numbers and operations may improve performance.</p>
			<h3>Test procedure</h3>
			<p>The following series of equations were input:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>936 / 18 * 271 + 2961</li>
				<li>299 / 13 * 12 - 8294</li>
				<li>297 / 11 * 967 * 95</li>
				<li>246 * 64 + 9526 + 453</li>
				<li>743 * 74 - 14 - 2230</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Questions generated with the help of <a href="https://mathsbot.com/questionGenerator">mathsbot.com</a>, and rearranged to simplify order of operations.</p>
			<p>Each keyboard layout was used to input the five equations three times each. The total time to complete the set and the number of errors were recorded. I considered an error to be when I pressed an incorrect number or operation (so pressing the wrong row and letting it run to the end and go back to row scanning was not considered an error).</p>
			<h3>Results</h3>
			<p>Original Layout:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>4:40, 0 mistakes</li> 280
				<li>4:40, 1 mistake</li> 280
				<li>5:03, 1 mistake</li> 303
			</ol>
			<p>Alternate Layout:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>4:48, 0 mistakes</li> 288
				<li>5:14, 1 mistake</li> 314
				<li>4:20, 0 mistakes</li> 260
			</ol>
			<p>Mean time for original: 287.67. Mean mistakes for original: .67</p>
			<p>Mean time for alternate: 287.33. Mean mistakes for alternate: .33</p>
			<h3>Discussion</h3>
			<p>There doesn't appear to be any significance between the two layouts. Anecdotally, I didn't really notice any difference between the two. While using the alternate layout, I thought it was nice to have the operations all in one place so I always knew when an alternate was coming up, but it also increased the time it took to circle back to the beginning of the numbers, so it felt like a wash.</p>
